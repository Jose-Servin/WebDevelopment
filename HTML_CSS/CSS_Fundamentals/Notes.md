# What is CSS?

CSS describes the visual style and presentation of the content written in HTML. <br>

CSS takes on the format of a dictionary consisting on `property: value` pairs which make up a `declaration/style`.
Multiple `declarations/styles` are in the `declaration block` which in turn make up a `CSS rule`.

# Inline, Internal and External CSS

* Inline CSS <br>
  Writing the CSS inside the HTML element. Note that inline styling should never be used because it creates entanglement
  between HTML and CSS elements. Goes against "separation of concern" (SoC): a design principle separating a computer
  program into distinct sections.

````html
<h1 style="color:cornflowerblue;"> ðŸ“˜ The Code Magazine</h1>
````

* Internal CSS <br>
  Declaring a `<style> </style>` element in the `<head> </head>` of our HTML doc. This is a good beginner option but
  presents issues since it can drastically increase the length of our HTML document.

```html

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML </title>
    <!-- <link href="main_style.css" rel="stylesheet"> -->
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: cornflowerblue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

* External CSS <br>
  Using a `style.css` sheet to hold the various CSS properties for our HTML elements. This is the best option since it
  properly separates out HTML code from our CSS rules. To implement:

First we declare the style sheet in our HTML doc:

```html

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML </title>
    <link href="main_style.css" rel="stylesheet">

</head>
```

Second, we define our CSS rules in `style.css`:

```css
h1 {
    color: firebrick;
}
```
