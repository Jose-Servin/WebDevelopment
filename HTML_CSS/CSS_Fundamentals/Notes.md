# What is CSS?

CSS describes the visual style and presentation of the content written in HTML. <br>

CSS takes on the format of a dictionary consisting on `property: value` pairs which make up a `declaration/style`.
Multiple `declarations/styles` are in the `declaration block` which in turn make up a `CSS rule`.

# Inline, Internal and External CSS

* Inline CSS <br>
  Writing the CSS inside the HTML element. Note that inline styling should never be used because it creates entanglement
  between HTML and CSS elements. Goes against "separation of concern" (SoC): a design principle separating a computer
  program into distinct sections.

````html
<h1 style="color:cornflowerblue;"> ðŸ“˜ The Code Magazine</h1>
````

* Internal CSS <br>
  Declaring a `<style> </style>` element in the `<head> </head>` of our HTML doc. This is a good beginner option but
  presents issues since it can drastically increase the length of our HTML document.

```html

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML </title>
    <!-- <link href="main_style.css" rel="stylesheet"> -->
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: cornflowerblue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

* External CSS <br>
  Using a `style.css` sheet to hold the various CSS properties for our HTML elements. This is the best option since it
  properly separates out HTML code from our CSS rules. To implement:

First we declare the style sheet in our HTML doc:

```html

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML </title>
    <link href="main_style.css" rel="stylesheet">

</head>
```

Second, we define our CSS rules in `style.css`:

```css
h1 {
    color: firebrick;
}
```

# Styling Text

There are various text properties that can be applied to most HTML elements. Some of the most common ones are:

```css
h1 {
    color: firebrick;
    font-size: 26px;
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-style: normal;
    text-align: center;
}
```

It is important to note that for `<ol>` or `<ul>` elements, only the `<li>` elements can be styled. So, we style the
list item not the actual list structure. We also see how inheritance works in CSS because all other elements inside
our `<p>` elements get styled based on the rules set for those p elements.

# Combining Selectors

Before combining selectors we have:

```css
h1 {
    color: firebrick;
    font-size: 26px;
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-style: normal;
    text-align: center;
}

h2 {
    font-size: 40px;
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
    font-style: normal;
}

h3 {
    font-size: 30px;
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
}


h4 {
    font-size: 20px;
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    font-size: 22px;
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.5;
    color: dimgrey;
}

li {
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

Which shows how some properties are repeated. We can eliminate this redundancy and implement best practices by combining
selectors using `list selectors`:

```css
h1, h2, h3, h4, p, li {
    font-family: 'League Gothic', sans-serif;
}
```

Now, any change in the font-family will be implemented on all elements, and we won't have to change them one by one.

## Descendent Selector

To change the `<p>` text of the `<footer>` we use descendent selectors to specify we would like to change the p text of
the footer only.

```css
footer p {
    font-size: 12px;
}
```

Here we are saying "select the child p element of the footer element." It is important to note that descendent selectors
can present issues when the same parent-child relationships exists in our HTML doc.

```html

<div>
    <header>
        <p> What we want to style </p>
    </header>
</div>
<article>
    <header>
        <p> We do not want to style this </p>
    </header>
</article>
```

In this example, if we use descendent selector we would use `header p` but this would select both `p` tags in our doc.
To fix this, we use nested-descendent selectors:

```css
article header p {
    color: red;
}
```

# Class and ID Selectors
